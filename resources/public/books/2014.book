Presentation Zen

Broadly speaking Presentation Zen contains good advice about preparing your presentations,
making sure they are elegant and memorable, and making sure that you are engage your audience.
There were certainly some valuable takeaway points.  However, for a book that is
extolling the virtues of keeping your message terse, it seemed too long, and could definitely
be shorter.  I also find the tendency that some of these corporate books have to appropriate
Zen ideas a bit nauseating.  But like I say, the tips in this book are perfectly sensible.
